    "# Comparing the effects of different longwave radiation parameterization on simulated snow\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this exercise we will explore how variability and uncertainty in longwave radiation affects simulations of snow. Longwave radiation, or thermal radiation, is emitted from objects and depends on the object's \"emissivity\" and temperature. The longwave radiation can be calculated as\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$ LW = \\epsilon \\sigma T^4 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\epsilon$ is the emissivity, $\\sigma$ is the [Stephan-Boltzmann constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_constant), and $T$ is the temperature (in Kelvin). Because longwave radiation is rarely measured, many models require estimations to close the energy balance. The FluxNet community maintains a large number of the sites where longwave measurements are taken across the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Locations of FluxNet towers throughout the world**\n",
    "![locations of fluxnet towers throughout the world](./assets/fluxnet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, there are only a couple hundred sites throughout the world and are particularly concentrated in North America and Europe. While other locations and consortiums for measuring longwave exist (such as a handful of SnoTel sites), they are still _very_ sparse throughout the world, and even through the United States. So, if we want to be able to model basins without observations we will need to estimate the longwave radiation. This mostly amounts to estimation of the emissivity, as temperature can be more easily taken from measurement, reanalysis, or simulated  (somewhat) reliably. There are a multitude of methods for estimating this, of which we will explore a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Study sites \n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we have provided SUMMA setups for 3 sites with different hydroclimates. These sites were chosen because they do have longwave radiation measurements, and allow us to compare the simulated snowpack with the different estimation methods. These sites are Dana Meadows in Yosemite National park, Reynolds Mountain East (part of the [Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed](https://czo-archive.criticalzone.org/reynolds/infrastructure/field-areas-reynolds/) in southwestern Idaho, and Col de Porte in the Chartreuse Mountains near Grenoble, France. The three site locations and their long term temperature records are shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Locations of study sites**\n",
    "![locations of study sites](./assets/snow_sites.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have put together three years of data for each of the sites which can be used to run the SUMMA hydrologic model. SUMMA takes longwave radiation as an input variable, so we will provide both the observed and estimated values to compare how they affect the snowpack evolution. As mentioned above, there are several methods for estimating longwave radiation. \n",

    "## Longwave radiation parameterizations\n",

    "As described above, we have provided implementations of each of these longwave parameters which you will compare. We have also provided the data and functions to get you started. To begin we import some standard librarires. The `utilities` library is where we have implemented the specific functionality for you to be able to modify the longwave radiation. Additionally, we have implemented simple cloud correction schemes, which further modify the longwave radiation when there is cloud cover. You can think of clouds as a blanket which insulate the land surface, increasing the longwave radiation. As you might have noticed above, this cloud cover correction is built into the DOKIA method. We will describe how to activate the cloud cover fraction later.\n",
